# Inspiration

The USC dining website is clunky and cluttered. It shows you a lot of items you simple don't care for, and it presents breakfast and lunch menus even when they're no longer available so you have to scroll all the way down to access what's for dinner. And sometimes, it switches to the next date when it's still the current date, therefore misleading students.

# What it does

DineOn fetches data from the USC dining websites, scrapes it, and presents it in a beautiful user interface that is designed for iPhone, iPad, Mac and Vision Pro. It allows you to set preferences for food, such as allergens or dietary preferences, and filters out the dining content based on your likings. You can set up food you have liked and disliked in the past, and your favorite dishes will be highlighted while things you didn't like will simply be hidden away.

# What's next for DineOn!

In a future version, the data about your preferences will be used in conjunction with an on device AI model to provide you with suggestions on where to eat if good food that aligns with your preferences is available in any of the dining halls, including a notification summary including the best things available today.
